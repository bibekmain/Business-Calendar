# Business-Calendar
This is a business calendar that uses HTML, CSS, Java Script, and JQuery to help a user organize their day into hourly blocks of time.

## Languages and Resources used:
* *HTML*
* *CSS*
* *JavaScript*: JQuery and dayjs

## Tutorial:  
When first loading into the webpage, the user will be introduced with an empty list of tasks for the day.  

Each hour block is color coded based on **past**, **present**, and **future**. A **gray** box indicates past times, a **red** box indicates the current hour, while a **green** box indicates the future times for the given day.  

Enter text in the textarea and click on the save button on the right side to save the data to the browser's local storage. When the page is refreshed, all the saved data will be recovered and shown.
